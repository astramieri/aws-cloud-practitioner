# Serveless Introduction

Severless is a new paradigm in which the developers do nott manage the servers anymore. Developers "just" deploy the codes.

Serverless was pioneered as a **Function as a Service (FaaS)** with **AWS Lambda** but now also includes anything that's managed (database, messaging, storage, etc.).

Serverless does not mean there are no servers. It means you just don't manage/provision/see them.

Serverless examples:
- Amazon S3
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Fargate
- Amazon Lambda
