# IAM Security Tools

Two main tools:

- **IAM Credentials Report** (account-level)
    - a report that list all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
    - a report that provides detailed information about the rotation history of user passwords and access key rotation, along with usernames and key IDS
- **IAM Access Advisor** (user-level)
    - it shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
    - you can user this information to revise your policies
