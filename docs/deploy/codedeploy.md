# CodeDeploy

- It is a way to deploy applications **automatically**
- It is completely **independent** (from Elastic Beanstalk or CloudFormation)
- It is an **hybrid service** because it works with:
    - EC2 instances
    - On-Premises Servers

**NOTE**. Servers/Instances must be provisioned and configured ahead of time with the **CodeDeploy Agent**.
