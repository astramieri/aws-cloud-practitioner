# CodeStar Basics

**NOTE. AWS CodeStart will be discontinued as of July 2024. It has a replacement named CodeCatalyst.**

**CodeStar** is a unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place.

CodeStar is a quick way to get started to correctly set-up CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, etc.

CodeStart can edit the code "in the cloud" using **AWS Cloud9**.
