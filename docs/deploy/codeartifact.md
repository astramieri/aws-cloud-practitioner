# CodeArtifact

Sofware packages depend on each other to be built (also called code dependencies) and new oner are created. Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called **artifact management**.

**CodeArtifact** is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective **artifact management** for software development. 

Developer and CodeBuild can retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact.

CodeArtifact works with common dependecy management tools such as Mave, Gradle, npm, yarn, pip, etc.
