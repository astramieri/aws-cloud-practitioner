# CodeDeploy Basics

- It is a way to deploy applications **automatically**
- It is completely **independent** (from Beanstalk or CloudFormation)
- It is an **hybrid service** because it works with:
    - EC2 instances
    - On-Premises Servers

Note. Servers/Instances must be provisioned and configured ahead of time with the **CodeDeploy Agent**.
