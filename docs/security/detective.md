# AWS Detective

- GuardDuty, Macie, and Security Hub are used to identify potential security issues or findings
- Sometimes security findings require deeper analysis to isolate the root cause and take action (it's a comples process)
- Amazon Detective analyzes, investigates, and quickly identifies **the root causes of security issues** or suspicious activities (using ML and graphs)
- Automatically collects and processes event from VPC Flow Logs, Cloud Trail, GuardDuty and create a unified view
- Produces visualizations with details and context to get to the root cause
