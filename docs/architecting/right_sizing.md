# AWS Right Sizing

- EC2 has many instances type, but choosing the most powerful instance type isn't the best choice, because **the cloud is elastic**
- **Right Sizing** is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the **lowest possible cost**
- Scaling up is easy so **always start small**
- It's also the process of looing at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements which results in lower costs
- It's important to Right Size:
    - before a Cloud Migration
    - continuously after the cloud onboarding process (requirements change over time)
- Tools that can help: CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, 3rd party tools, etc.
