# AWS Well-Architected Framework - Pillar 1: Operational Excellence

- Includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
- Design Principles
    - **Performs operations as code**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    - **Annotate documentation**: Automate the creation of annotated documentation after every build
    - **Make frequent, small, reversibile changes**: So that in case of failure, you can reverse it
    - **Refine operations procedures frequently**: And ensure that team members are familiar with it
    - **Anticipate failure**
    - **Learn from operational failure**
