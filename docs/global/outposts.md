# Outposts

Hybrid Cloud is when business keeps an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure.

Two ways of dealing with IT systems:
- One for the AWS Cloud (using the AWS console, AWS CLI and AWS APIs)
- One for their on-premises infrastructure

**AWS Outposts are "server racks"** that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own application on-premises just as in the cloud.

AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises.

You are responsibile for the Outposts Racks physical security because that rack is in your data center.
