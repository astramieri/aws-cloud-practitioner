# AWS Service Catalog

- Users that are new to AWS have too many options, and may create stacks that not compliant/in-line with the rest of the organization
- Some users just want a quick **self-service portal** to launch a set of **authorized products** pre-defined **by admins**
- Includes: virtual machines, databases, storage options, etc.
